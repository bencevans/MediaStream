#MediaSocket

MediaSocket is a HTML5 Video Experiment. It supports *streaming* video and no audio (Good for a game of [charades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charades)).

The idea to build a simplistic video chat came about a while ago when it took about 20 minutes for me and a friend to download required software and register to a service etc. Sure this isn't quite there but it's an excuse to play around with the HTML5 getUserMedia etc.
